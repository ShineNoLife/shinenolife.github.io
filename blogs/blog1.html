                    I started my competitive programming journey in 8th grade, from then I have participated in many competitions and events,
                    here's a collection of the interesting things I've done throughout my journey.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    The early stages of my journey
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During 8th grade i had no particular idea of what programming is, but since some of my online friends were 
                    programmers, i decided to try out the Informatics training class at my school. There i learned to write my first
                    line of code in Pascal, and learned to solve basic problems. I was fascinated by how these things worked, and took
                    a liking to solving problems that the teachers gave me.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Later on i continued to spend my time learning and solving harder problems, eventually getting into the City's Olympiad
                    Team, and Getting the First Prize at the Provincial Informatics Contest for secondary school students. During this period i 
                    was very interested in solving problems, they gave me a sense of challenge and beauty, which i enjoyed.

                    Competitions during my high school years
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After the fun 9th grade, i spent time preparing for exams and got admitted to the best high school in my province,
                    studying in a Informatics Specialized Class. Interestingly i got the highest marks in the entire province, even though
                    at that point i wasn't particularly a studious person   
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I got to participate many summer camps aimed for specialized students. Participating in these camps 
                    was quite a memorizable aspect of my high school years, since i got to meet like-minded people that also 
                    enjoyed competitive programming, later on these people would be a big inspiration for me to keep on improving

                    Vietnamese National Olympiad In Informatics
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Vietnamese National Olympiad In Informatics is the most prestigious Competition for highschool students specialized in Informatics
                    across all highschools of VietNam. Achieving a Prize in this Olympiad is no doubt one of my biggest goal that i was very passionate about
                    at this point in time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Around early 11th grade, i was chosen for the National Olympiad team representing my Province. I spent quite a lot of my time 
                    training in this time period, which increased my skills quite significantly, thus getting a Second Prize in the 2023 National Olympiad. 
                    This was a big motivator to me at the time, which has motivated me to learn more interesting and complicated techniques for solving problems,
                    although i didnt perform as well during 12th grade, getting another Second Prize. I was quite sad bout my performance, but nonetheless pursuing
                    competitive programming helped me develop a love for solving problems.

                    Because i feel like Informatics was a very interesting but underappreciated subject, i and the members of the

                    ICPC, or the International Collegiate Programming Contest,
                    is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious global programming competition for college students. 
                    At the core it fosters problemsolving skills along with teamwork, this is the next step from the National Olympiads in high school

                    In my undergraduate year at university, me and my team participated in the ICPC National Vietnam, 
                    then the ICPC Asia Regional, which was held in Hanoi. We performed pretty well at the Regional contest, earning the 
                    top 10 place amongst all the Vietnamese team, we were then selected to participate in the ICPC 2025 Asia Pacific Championship,
                    which has a total of 65 teams from Universities across the Asia Pacific area competing. That was the first year that my university
                    was able to participate in the championship, and not only that there were 3 teams going :D.

                    The 2025 ICPC Asia Pacific Championship was held in Singapore, hosted by The National University of Singapore (NUS),
                    this was the first time that i traveled oversea, i was so excited for this event. During the Championship i got to talk 
                    and socialize with people, there we even some quant companies giving out merch and hosting discussions, i also got to experience
                    the food from many cultures, and the beautiful places in Singapore aswell. I particularly liked the trees in Singapore, you can see 
                    trees everywhere you go, which contributed to the country's refreshing atmostphere and invigorating ambience.
